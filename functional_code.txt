The result of executing the following code will print out the number ten on the first line followed by the number eleven 
on a separate line. The code will then finally print the statement “Final Report:” on a third line followed by the numbers 
twelve, fifteen, and eighteen to finish. The reason for this is at the start of the program a list is created that contains
 the numbers ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty in that order. It 
then initializes a counter variable equal to zero. The items in the list are then looped using a for loop specifically to 
increment the counter by one and then check if the counter is less than three. If the counter is then it prints the current
 number to the console, resulting in the ten and eleven we see in the first two lines of output. Thus every other value after 
is then ignored by the program and moves on to printing the final report. Once the loop is finished the program specifically 
prints three items the third, sixth, and eighth elements of the list. The corresponding indexes two, five, and seven reciprocate 
the values stated previously, that being twelve, fifteen, and eighteen. These indexes are then placed in front of the string and 
separated by commas before being printed on the third and final line. With this, we can figure that the first two values will 
always be printed as well as the three specific index elements granted there is a minimum of eight present.
